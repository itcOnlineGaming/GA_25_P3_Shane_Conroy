## **Brief Description**  
The **Entity Spawn Manager** is a **grid-based** component that allows developers to quickly generate a grid at a desired location and assign specific entities to spawn within each tile. This will give developers an easy method of generating a grid and spawning prefabs before run time.

### **Key Features**  
- Users can define **constraints** for entity placement within the grid:
- 
- User can assign the amount of the rows and cols via the inspector
    - Putting these numbers in will result in a grid shown below

    - If no specific rows or columns are defined, entities will spawn randomly.
